Table definition files instruct the data generator how to generate data.  Files
should be named after the name of the table to generate with a .ddf extension.
The resulting data files will have a .data extension.  For example,
tablename.ddf will generate a tablename.data file.

The format of the file will contain the total number of row to generate on the
first line.  Each subsequent line in the file will represent the columns to
generate.

For example:

    10
    s1

This will generate a data file with 10 rows and 1 column, where that column is
a sequence of numbers starting from 1.

Column definitions:

i<min>,<max> - Random integer of random length between <min> and <max>
s<integer> - Sequence starting from <integer>
t<min>,<max> - Random string of random length between <min> and <max>
